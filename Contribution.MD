You are free to make improvements and offer advice on how I can make improvements. I've made this project OSS because my course is incomplete and I'm stuck. 
I'd like to learn from professional developers on what the best practices are 
and how to collaborate within a team enviroment. 

Create a pull request and/or comment a suggestion in the discussion page. I'd appreciate a brief explanation on what you did and why, so I can learn from you. 


Thanks in advance.
